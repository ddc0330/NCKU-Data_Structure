# NCKU Data Structure – C Coursework

This repository contains homework assignments and exercises from the **Data Structure** course offered by the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at **National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)**.

## Course Topics

The course focuses on both theoretical and practical understanding of essential data structures, including:

- **Linear Data Structures**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

- **Trees**
  - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - Heap and Heap Sort
  - AVL Trees and balanced structures

- **Graphs**
  - Adjacency Matrix & List representations
  - Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s, Kruskal’s)
  - Shortest Path (Dijkstra’s)

- **Hashing and Searching Techniques**
  - Hash tables and collision handling
  - Binary and linear search algorithms

- **Memory Management and Recursion**
  - Pointer manipulation and dynamic memory allocation
  - Recursive implementation of algorithms
